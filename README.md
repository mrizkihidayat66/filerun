### FileRun
This repository contains a Docker image for FileRun (version 20220519), which is the last available free version of the FileRun product that was released several years ago. As FileRun has transitioned to a commercial model, where only the latest versions require a purchase, this image serves as a stable reference point for users who need access to this earlier version.

### Overview
FileRun is a robust file management system that offers a range of features to enhance productivity and collaboration. This Docker image allows you to quickly set up FileRun in a containerized environment, leveraging Dockerâ€™s capabilities to streamline deployment and management. With this image, you can access essential functionalities without the need for ongoing updates that may disrupt your workflow.
